# CandyFight

The game was built as part of an assignment in a computer game development course.

The purpose of the assignment is to  build a "game" for two players, each player can move one character, and each player sees the world from their character's point of view, on half a screen.

* **The green player** - moves by the **arrows** on the keyboard.

* **The blue player** - moves up with the **W button**, down with the **S button**, right with the **D button** and left with the **A button**.

The goal of the game is to fight for the candy.
